## What it does
- One interactive chart covering all weekdays in February 2026 (no day filter)
- Weeks are stacked top-to-bottom (Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4) like the Excel structure

- Lunch locked from `1:00 PM` to `2:00 PM`
- Paint cells by brand color (click or click-drag)
- Eraser mode
- Totals by brand (full month) and team member (full month)
